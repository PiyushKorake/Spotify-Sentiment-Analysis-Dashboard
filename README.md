# Spotify Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is about understanding what users feel about Spotify by reading their reviews. We used Python to do sentiment analysis and then created visual dashboards using Tableau to show the results. The goal is to see how people react to Spotifyâ€™s content and features over time.

## Objectives
- Check how user sentiments change with time
- Count how many reviews are positive, negative, or neutral
- Find out if review length depends on the sentiment
- See if ratings and sentiments are related
- Compare how songs perform on Spotify, Apple Music, and Deezer
- Understand the music features that make songs popular
- See how streaming numbers and chart positions are connected
- Analyze genre and audience preferences

## Tools and Methods
- Python for sentiment analysis using BERT
- Tableau for creating dashboards
- Used pandas and numpy for data handling
- Data was cleaned and preprocessed before visualization

## Dataset
- User review dataset with fields like review text, time, rating, and sentiment score
- Spotify song dataset with track info, artist name, streams, playlists, charts, bpm, key, energy, valence, etc.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that most Spotify users are happy with the service. Sentiment analysis helps understand how users feel and what can be improved. Platforms and artists show different patterns, which can be helpful for marketing and recommendations.

## Future Work
